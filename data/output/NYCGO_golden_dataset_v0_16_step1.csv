This integration was part of a broader initiative to streamline and enhance the city's technology and innovation efforts by merging several technology-focused entities, including the NYC Office of Data Analytics (ODA), the Mayor's Office of the Chief Technology Officer (MOCTO), the Mayor's Office of Information Privacy (MOIP), and NYC 311. While the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) continues to exist solely for legal contract purposes, its operational functions, including those of NYC Cyber Command, have been incorporated into OTI. This consolidation aims to create a unified approach to technology deployment and innovation, improving service efficiency and coordination across NYC government agencies.",,,,,NYC Cyber Command (NYC3),,NYC Cyber Command,,,,,,True,Kelly Moan,Kelly,,Moan,,TRUE,Office of Technology and Innovation,
